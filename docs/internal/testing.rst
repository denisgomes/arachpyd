Testing
=======

**arackpy** uses tox for testing across multiple versions of python. Change to
the project directory and type the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    cdproject
    tox

This will run tests for all the different instances of python specified in the
tox.ini file.

.. note:: You'll need to have all versions of python being tested installed on your system.
