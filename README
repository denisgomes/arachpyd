**arackpy**
===========

**arackpy** is a simple but powerful web crawler and scraper. Although it is
good natured and respectful at heart, it can be used to do evil. Remember with
great power comes great responsibility.


Requirements
------------

**arackpy** currently supports Python 2.7 and 3.6+ out of the box. Depending on
the data you want to extract, future releases will require one or more of the
dependencies below to be installed to support the various backends:

* beautifulSoup and lxml
* requests
* pysocks
* fake_useragent
* selenium


Installation
------------

For the vanilla **arackpy** install do a simple pip install:

    pip install arackpy

The following packages may also be installed:

    pip install bs4, lxml, requests, pysocks, fake_useragent, selenium


Quickstart
----------

Open up your favorite python text editor and type the following:

    # hello_spider.py

    from __future__ import division     # for python 2.7

    from arackpy.spider import Spider


    class HelloSpider(Spider):
        """A simple spider in just ten lines of working code"""

        start_urls = ["https://www.python.org"]

        def parse(self, url, html):
            """Extract data from the raw html"""
            print("Crawling url, %s" % url)


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        print("Press Ctrl-c to stop crawling")
        spider = HelloSpider()
        spider.crawl()

Run the program using:

    python hello_spider.py

Note

Press Ctrl-c to terminate crawling.
